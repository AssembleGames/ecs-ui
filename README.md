# Unity uGui extension for Entity Component System framework
Easy bindings for events from Unity uGui to [ECS framework](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs) - main goal of this extension.

> Tested on unity 2017.4 (dependent on Unity engine) and contains assembly definition for compiling to separate assembly file for performance reason.

> Dependent on [ECS framework](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs) - ECS framework should be imported to unity project first.

# Systems

## EcsUiEmitter

Ecs run-system that generates entities with events data to `ecs world`. Should be placed on root GameObject of Ui hierarchy in scene and connected in `ecs world` before any systems that should process events from ui:
```
public class Startup : MonoBehaviour {
    // Field that should be initialized by instance of `EcsUiEmitter` assigned to Ui root GameObject.
    [SerializeField]
    EcsUiEmitter _uiEmitter;

    EcsSystems _systems;

    void Start () {
        var world = new EcsWorld ();
        _systems = new EcsSystems(world)
            .Add (_uiEmitter);
            // Additional initialization here...
        _systems.Initialize ();
    }
}
```

## EcsUiCleaner
Ecs run-system that cleanup all ui events in world after processing. Should be added to `EcsSystems` after all systems that can process events from ui:
```
public class Startup : MonoBehaviour {
    // Field that should be initialized by instance of `EcsUiEmitter` assigned to Ui root GameObject.
    [SerializeField]
    EcsUiEmitter _uiEmitter;

    EcsSystems _systems;

    void Start () {
        var world = new EcsWorld ();
        _systems = new EcsSystems(world)
            .Add (_uiEmitter);
            // Additional initialization here...
            .Add (new EcsUiCleaner ());
        _systems.Initialize ();
    }
}
```

> **Important: if this system will not be added - generated ui events will be kept inside `ecs-world` forever.**

# Actions
MonoBehaviour components that should be added to uGui widgets to transfer events from them to `ecs-world` (`EcsUiClickAction`, `EcsUiDragAction` and others). Each action component contains reference to `EcsUiEmitter` in scene (if not inited - will try to find emitter automatically) and logical name `WidgetName` that can helps to detect source of event inside ecs-system.

# Components
Event data containers: `EcsUiClickEvent`, `EcsUiBeginDragEvent`, `EcsUiEndDragEvent` and others - they can be used as ecs-components with standard filtering through `EcsFilter`:
```
public class TestUiClickEventSystem : EcsReactSystem {
    [EcsWorld]
    EcsWorld _world;

    [EcsFilterInclude (typeof (EcsUiClickEvent))]
    EcsFilter _clickEvents;

    public override EcsFilter GetReactFilter () {
        return _clickEvents;
    }

    public override EcsReactSystemType GetReactSystemType () {
        return EcsReactSystemType.OnAdd;
    }

    public override EcsRunSystemType GetRunSystemType () {
        return EcsRunSystemType.Update;
    }

    public override void RunReact (List<int> entities) {
        foreach (var entity in entities) {
            var data = _world.GetComponent<EcsUiClickEvent> (entity);
            Debug.Log ("Im clicked!", data.HitResult.gameObject);
        }
    }
}
```
